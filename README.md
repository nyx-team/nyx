# Nyx

**Nyx is a Multi-purpose, open-source Discord Bot, made in JS and Python.**

[Invite the Bot here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=960533661109878805&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=545394261246)

## Configuration

**You will need to generate a config file to run the Bot**

Generate one by doing: `python make_config.py`

It should generate a `config.json` file in the `src` directory.

Then fill in the credentials needed to run the bot (e.g. `"TOKEN"`)

Config should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": "TOKEN HERE"
}
```
